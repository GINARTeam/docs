## Credit Card Authorization

Your provided Credit Cards will be authorized by Stripe Payment Gateway.

To achieve the highest level of payment security and confidentiality, we follow the **[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards](https://stripe.com/guides/pci-compliance)** implemented by Stripe. Thus we do not store any customer credit card information in our system; instead, all the credit card information and payment records will be redirected to the Stripe Payment Gateway for processing.
