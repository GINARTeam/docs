GINAR system is running on a public blockchain along with a private blockchain of our own. The core idea is to make the system transparent and open participating while retaining the properties of fairness, tamper-resistance and unpredictability. The system allows anyone who wishes to verify the results as well as participate in the process of generating them.
The **GINAR Service** is a bridge between clients requesting random numbers and decentralized networks which oversees generating numbers
The **Core Layer** is in charge of generating the random numbers. This component is running on a permissioned blockchain that consists of many nodes distributed throughout the network. Each node in the Core Layer has a private key sk and a corresponding public key pk.
The **public blockchain** hosts a low-speed, open, multi-participatory RNG protocol to produce fair, verifiable numbers.
