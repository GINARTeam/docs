## 1. Introduction

GINAR is a service that provides random numbers based on blockchain technology with the following main characteristics: **unpredictability, public-verifiability, tamper-resistance**, and **transparency**. Public-verifiability is the property that enables anyone to check the correctness of random number generation from GINAR. We have APIs available to support authenticity verification.

## 2. How GINAR generate random numbers?

GINAR service generates a random number from the input **Ticket ID**. This Ticket ID contained: 
- **Machine ID**: The Machine ID which being defined by GINAR customers.
- **ETH entropy**: The entropy receive from Ethereum blockchain through dRNG smart contract
- **Timestamp** at receiving
- **Serial numbers**: Each customer has a set of serial numbers
- **User Data**: GINAR customers can decide whether or not to send their user data for contributing the ticket ID creation
- **Mockup ID**: The mockup procedure performed by GINAR system to create a specific ticket ID

After each successful query, a next Ticket ID is created from the previous Ticket ID following recursive formula. GINAR service keeps the hash of the genesis Ticket ID, this value will be published on blockchain for authenticity verification.

## 3. Verification Phase

Verification is of utmost importance in the process of generating random numbers because it is proof for transparency of our protocol. This phase verifies the validity of the total processing random number generator via the data on the blockchain and GINAR’s servers.
In order to verify a random number generated by GINAR, one has to:

- **Verify the correctness of the ticket ID**: check if the current ticket is generated from the previous ticket and the corresponding random number obtained from the public blockchain.
- **Verify the validity of each PoD (Proof of Designation)**: verify if the eligible-checking value was produced by the node by using the corresponding public key (pk).
- **Check the correctness**: if two steps above are valid then we will check the correctly of final random number result.

If one of the 3 steps above fails, the random number is considered not being generated correctly by GINAR and indicates that errors must have happened. Otherwise, the random number is said to be correctly generated.

## 4. Authenticity Verification

The verifying procedure shows details results from GINAR's Authenticity Verification API for a specific Ticket ID. This will guarantee that the randomization was performed with the input and output parameters listed and that the result shown was generated using Ethereum blockchain at the time given by the timestamp. It is impossible for anyone to have influenced the randomization. 

### Step 1: Input the Ticket ID

If the **Gaming/iGaming Providers** already integrated GINAR random service API, then you can simply click on **Verify Ticket** to access the **RNG Authenticity Verification**. Else, you can access the **Verification Tool** [here](https://blackbox.ginar.io), and enter **Ticket ID** then click **Verify**.

> **Ticket ID** - an identification for each beacon (random string) generated by GINAR System. 
You can use Ticket ID to verify beacon value and timestamp when this beacon has been generated. This value will be the root of all calculations for the later generation.



## Verification process

-	**Step 1**: Copy your ticket ID and paste to verification windows
-	**Step 2**: Click “Search” to verify your ticket ID. Next, the verified result will show up

> If the random number is incorrect, the tool will notify - **Ticket not found!**

> If the random number is correct, the tool will notify – **The result is valid**. There has a list of Eligible Contributors to be showed up. You click to **View Block Information** to check the details of Block Info and JSON Data.
