## Introduction

GINAR is a leading company in providing Decentralized Random Number Generation (dRNG) solutions to the iGaming industry. The main focus of whole GINAR, in general, and the focus of this upgrade, in particular, is on providing random numbers with the following characteristics: **unpredictability, public-verifiability, tamper-resistance, transparency**, and **high performance**. Public-verifiability is the property that enables anyone to check the correctness of random number generation from GINAR. We have APIs available to support authenticity verification. This document serves the purpose of explaining how to verify a random number generated by GINAR via an Authenticity Verification API.

If you wish to understand how ginar works in a simple way, please access to this [**Verification Simulator Tool**](https://simulator.ginar.io/#/)


## Authenticity Verification

GINAR provides a UI (called **Authenticity Verification API**) for the sake of making verification intuitively. The verification tool can be found [**HERE**](https://blackbox.ginar.io). At a high level, the verifying procedure shows all the details relating to how a random number is generated. Moreover, this information is written onto the Ethereum blockchain to guarantee that manipulating is impossible. Following is the description of how to use this tool. 

Note that each random beacon will be associated with a **TicketID**. This **TicketID** is sufficient to retrieve all the information relating to how a random number has been produced. 

### 1. Search the TicketID

If the **Gaming/iGaming Providers** already integrated GINAR random service API, then you can simply click on **Verify Ticket** to access the **RNG Authenticity Verification** tool. Else, you can access the **RNG Authenticity Verification** tool [**HERE**](https://blackbox.ginar.io), and enter **TicketID** then click **SEARCH**. 

![Step 1](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/Step%201.png?raw=true)

> **TicketID** - an identification for each beacon (random string) 

You can use TicketID to verify beacon value and timestamp when this beacon has been generated. This value will be the root of all calculations for the later generation.


### 2. Verification Results

- If you get a message **Ticket not found !**, that means the **TicketID** has not been initiated yet.

![NotFound](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/TicketNot%20Found.png?raw=true)

- If the TicketID is **found** and **used**, that means the **TicketID** had been initiated and used.

![Found](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/TicketFound.png?raw=true)

- If the **TicketID** is **found** and **unused**, that means the **TicketID** had been initiated but not yet used.

![Unused](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/Status%20Unused.png?raw=true)

> **Requester**: The customer’s name

> **Serial number**: An unique number allocated by GINAR corresponding to a given API key

> **Creator**: The creator of the ticket - **GINAR Decentralized RNG**.

> **Status**: **Used** - The ticket ID has been initiated and used / **Unused** - The ticket ID has been initiated but has not been used

- **Status - Unused** The **ticketID** has been initiated but has not been used

![StatusUnused](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/Status_Unused.png?raw=true)

- **Status - Used** The **ticketID** has been initiated and used

![StatusUsed](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/Status%20Used.png?raw=true)

> **Ticket ID**: An identification for each beacon (random string) generated by GINAR System

> **[CustomerName] User Data**: The specific caller before the random values were generated which sent by the Requester

> **Requester**: The customer’s name

> **Serial number**: An unique number allocated by GINAR corresponding to a given API key

> **Creator**: The creator of the ticket - GINAR Decentralized RNG

> **Status**: **Used** - The ticket ID has been initiated and used / **Unused** - The ticket ID has been initiated but has not been used

> **Etherium Entropy**: The entropy received from the public blockchain through the dRNG Smart Contract every 1 hour

> **Ethereum Batch of IDs Records**: The Merkle Trees method by combining multiple values and their hashes to reduce them to a single fixed-size value. Eventually, this will result in a single hash, known as the Merkle root

> **Created Timestamp**: The time when ticket being created

> **Numbers of GINAR Contributing Nodes**: the number of eligible nodes contributing to generating the random number

> **Generated Output**: The output random number

> **Used timestamp**: The time when the random number has been used

- To accessing the **Random Number Generating Process**, you can click to **View Eligible Contributors**. In here, you can verify the number of Eligible Nodes (GINARATORs) who contributing to generate the random number.

![Eligible](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/Eligible.png?raw=true)

> **Timestamp**: The time when the random number has been generated by the eligible node (GINARATOR)

> **Public key**: The public key of the eligible node (GINARATOR)

> **Credential**: The signature from PoD

> **Contribution**: The value contributed by the eligible node (GINARATOR)

> **Signature/Proof**: Proof of correctness of the contribution with respect to the Ticket ID and the Public key.
