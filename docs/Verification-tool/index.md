## Introduction

GINAR is a leading company in providing Decentralized Random Number Generation (dRNG) solutions to the iGaming industry. The main focus of whole GINAR, in general, and the focus of this upgrade, in particular, is on providing random numbers with the following characteristics: **unpredictability, public-verifiability, tamper-resistance, transparency**, and **high performance**. Public-verifiability is the property that enables anyone to check the correctness of random number generation from GINAR. We have APIs available to support authenticity verification. This document serves the purpose of explaining how to verify a random number generated by GINAR via an Authenticity Verification API.

## How GINAR generate random numbers?

GINAR service generates a random number from the input **Ticket ID**. This Ticket ID contained: 
- **Machine ID**: The Machine ID which being defined by GINAR customers.
- **ETH entropy**: The entropy receive from Ethereum blockchain through dRNG smart contract
- **Timestamp** at receiving
- **Serial numbers**: Each customer has a set of serial numbers
- **User Data**: GINAR customers can decide whether or not to send their user data for contributing the ticket ID creation

After each successful query, a next Ticket ID is created from the previous Ticket ID following recursive formula. GINAR service keeps the hash of the genesis Ticket ID, this value will be published on blockchain for authenticity verification.

## Verification Phase

Verification is of utmost importance in the process of generating random numbers because it is proof for transparency of our protocol. This phase verifies the validity of the total processing random number generator via the data on the blockchain and GINAR’s servers.
In order to verify a random number generated by GINAR, one has to:

- **Verify the correctness of the ticket ID**: check if the current ticket is generated from the previous ticket and the corresponding random number obtained from the public blockchain.
- **Verify the validity of each PoD (Proof of Designation)**: verify if the eligible-checking value was produced by the node by using the corresponding public key (pk).
- **Check the correctness**: if two steps above are valid then we will check the correctly of final random number result.

If one of the 3 steps above fails, the random number is considered not being generated correctly by GINAR and indicates that errors must have happened. Otherwise, the random number is said to be correctly generated.

## Authenticity Verification

The verifying procedure shows details results from GINAR's Authenticity Verification API for a specific Ticket ID. This will guarantee that the randomization was performed with the input and output parameters listed and that the result shown was generated using Ethereum blockchain at the time given by the timestamp. It is impossible for anyone to have influenced the randomization. 

### Step 1: Input the Ticket ID

If the **Gaming/iGaming Providers** already integrated GINAR random service API, then you can simply click on **Verify Ticket** to access the **RNG Authenticity Verification**. Else, you can access the **Verification Tool** [here](https://blackbox.ginar.io), and enter **Ticket ID** then click **Verify**. 

![Step 1](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/Step1.png?raw=true)

> **Ticket ID** - an identification for each beacon (random string) generated by GINAR System. 

You can use Ticket ID to verify beacon value and timestamp when this beacon has been generated. This value will be the root of all calculations for the later generation.

### Step 2: Verification Results

- If you get a message **Ticket not found !**, that means the **Ticket ID** has not been initiated yet.

![NotFound](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/TicketNotFound.png?raw=true)

- If the Ticket ID is **found** and **used**, that means the **Ticket ID** had been initiated and used.

![Found](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/TicketFound.png?raw=true)

- If the **Ticket ID** is **found** and **unused**, that means the **Ticket ID** had been initiated but not yet used.

![Unused](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/FoundUnused.png?raw=true)

> **Ticket ID**: An identification for each beacon (random string) generated by GINAR System

> **Requester**: The customer’s name

> **Serial number**: An unique number allocated by GINAR corresponding to a given API key

> **Creator**: The creator of the ticket - GINAR Decentralized RNG.

> **Status**: **Used** - The ticket ID has been initiated and used / **Unused** - The ticket ID has been initiated but has not been used

### Step 3: View Full Details

To check the details about the Randomization, click to **View Full Details**. This page shows the details of a response from GINAR random API with Input, Random Number generating process and Output, which identifies it uniquely amongst all responses generated.

The input information guarantees that the randomization was performed correctly with the Etherium entropy, user data at the time given by the timestamp. It is not possible for anyone to influence the randomization.

- **Status - Used** The ticket ID has been initiated and used

![StatusUsed](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/StatusUsed.png?raw=true)

- **Status - Unused** The ticket ID has been initiated but has not been used

![StatusUnused](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/StatusUnused.png?raw=true)

> **Ticket ID**: An identification for each beacon (random string) generated by GINAR System

> **[CustomerName] User Data**: The specific caller before the random values were generated which sent by the Requester

> **Requester**: The customer’s name

> **Serial number**: An unique number allocated by GINAR corresponding to a given API key

> **Creator**: The creator of the ticket - GINAR Decentralized RNG

> **Status**: **Used** - The ticket ID has been initiated and used / **Unused** - The ticket ID has been initiated but has not been used

> **Etherium Entropy**: The entropy received from the public blockchain through the dRNG Smart Contract every 1 hour

> **Ethereum Batch of IDs Records**: The Merkle Trees method by combining multiple values and their hashes to reduce them to a single fixed-size value. Eventually, this will result in a single hash, known as the Merkle root

> **Created Timestamp**: The time when ticket being created

> **Numbers of GINAR Contributing Nodes**: the number of eligible nodes contributing to generating the random number

> **Generated Output**: The output random number

> **Used timestamp**: The time when the random number has been used

- To accessing the **Random Number Generating Process**, you can click to **View Eligible Contributors**. In here, you can verify the number of Eligible Nodes (GINARATORs) who contributing to generate the random number.

![Eligible](https://github.com/GINARTeam/docs/blob/master/docs/Verification-tool/Eligible.png?raw=true)

> **Timestamp**: The time when the random number has been generated by the eligible node (GINARATOR)

> **Public key**: The public key of the eligible node (GINARATOR)

> **Credential**: The signature from PoD

> **Contribution**: The value contributed by the eligible node (GINARATOR)

> **Signature/Proof**: Proof of correctness of the contribution with respect to the Ticket ID and the Public key.
